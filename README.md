# We've Moved!
The GitHub Training Team Materials are in the process of moving to a [new materials-only repo](https://github.com/github/training-materials).  This migration will help us publish our open source courseware in a way that makes it even easier for anyone to reuse them and potentially contribute enhancements.

## Historical Preservation
All links to existing [training.github.com](http://training.github.com) public-facing URLs, such as [slide decks](http://training.github.com/presentations) and [outlines](http://training.github.com/courses) will continue to function as they do today.  [This repo](https://github.com/github/training.github.com) will not be removed, and all its contents are accessible [via the pre-move commit](https://github.com/github/training.github.com/tree/7049d7532a6856411e34046aedfce43a4afaf424).
